#      C-90 BRAINSTORMING PROJECT

We can see so much issues of people regarding forgetting things. May be it may be something which is related to their daily life. Here, in my app I would like to help the people of all age categories who are facing this issues. Also people who are having alchemies for a bit can make use of my app.

My app will be divided to many screens through which the user can navigate. Also we’ll be asking for the user’s email and password which we’ll be saving in the database. In the starting of our app we’ll ask the user to login or sing up. Proceeding this we’ll take the survey of the user about the most important things which he forgets in his daily life and some questions regarding it. This will be the preliminary stage of the app and this screen will only appear again only if the user log out from the app. The next time the player use the app is for seeking its help. That is through the survey our app can understand which thing the user has forgotten now and help him to remember it by showing some places which the player tell us in his first survey. If these options does not help the user to figure out what he is looking for in the next step we’ll provide an other survey sheet through which we’ll ask some intellectual questions that will help the user to remember and get the thing which he is looking for. Through this we can help a person to remember his things so quickly and help him save some time. The app will be simple and it will help people a lot
